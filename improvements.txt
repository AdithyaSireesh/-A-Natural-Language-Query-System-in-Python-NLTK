Ambiguity is a problem while parsing sentences. There could be a few ways to
reduce/nullify this problem.
The sentences are checked to only agree in number. If they were checked in
person and gender, then the system would check only grammatically correct
sentences.
Another way to disambiguate would be to present the different interpretations
to the user and to as the user to pick the interpretation that he/she prefers
(Unambiguity).
We could also assign probabilities for the grammar rules, and after using
an appropriate parsing algorithm(Earley , CYK/CKY, Veterbi etc.).

The system understands only simple sentences with just one adjective or one
noun i.e Gordon is a good chef is parsed, but Gordon is not given the right
unary relationships. However, Gordon is good, and Gordon is a chef, when
parsed separately, the system assigns the necessary relationships with Gordon.

When the user asks the question ‘Who is a good chef?’, the system returns
Gordon. I feel this is a downside of the system as we are not actually sure as
to whether Gordon is actually a ‘good’ chef.
